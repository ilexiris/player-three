PLAYER THREE
 Player three is a judge that can help two people play Scrabble together.

 RUN INSTRUCTIONS
  A `podman` user can likely run `./run-fresh.sh` and get things up running.

  A Docker user may have to make minor adjustments for things to run, such as
  changing command in the `run-fresh.sh` file, and renaming the Containerfile
  to Dockerfile.

 RUNNING TESTS
  With the server up running, one can run the tests by running `./run-tests.sh`

 ENDPOINTS
  There is only one endpoint, and it reveals the hand of the player who is about to place a word.
  The endpoint is located at http://localhost:8080/index.php/
  Parameters are appended onto that, separated by slashes.
  The first argument is the game seed. 
  All remaning arguments are moves.

 PLAY INSTRUCTIONS

  START A NEW GAME
   The player who wants to start visits this URL where 42 is their chosen seed: http://localhost:8080/index.php/42/
   A random seed can be generated by rolling dice in real life.

  PLACE LETTERS
   You make your move by appending it to the URL.
   Moves are separated by slashes.
   See section MOVE NOTATION below for instructions.
   Send the URL to your opponent.
   Do this without visiting it yourself, as that would reveal their hand to you, which would be cheating.
   This goes back and forth until the game is over.

 MOVE NOTATION
  The notation consists of four parts:
  1) X coordinate of the first letter (hexadecimal digit 0-e)
  2) Direction (x or y)
  3) Y coordinate of the first letter (hexadecimal digit 0-e)
  4) The letters from your hand that you want to place to form your words

  In the example below, the following words are played:
  Turn 1: Player 1 playes TUNE as the first word.
  Turn 2: Player 2 playes the letters HVI vertically, to form the Finnish word HEVI, using the E from TUNE.
  Turn 3: Player 1 forms the word KIDS by playing the letters KDS horizontally, using the I from HEVI.

  Player 2 now looks at their hand by visiting this URL: http://localhost:8080/index.php/42/7x7TUNE/ay6HVI/9x9KDS
  This is what they see:
